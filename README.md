Homework 6

In Homework 6, I created a Weather dashboard. When you search for a city, you can then view the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index. The uv index is color coded based on conditions. When you search for cities they will append below providing you with a history. I also created a bootstrap card to display the 5-day forecast.
